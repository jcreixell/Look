Our Copyright Policy
====================

look! uses a shared copyright model. Each contributor maintains copyright
over their contributions to look!. However, it is important to note that
these contributions are typically only changes to the repositories. Thus,
the look! source code, in its entirety, is not the copyright of any single
person or institution. Instead, it is the collective copyright of the
entire Look! Development Team. If individual contributors want to maintain
a record of what changes/contributions they have specific copyright on,
they should indicate their copyright in the commit message of the change
when they commit the change to one of the Look! repositories.

With this in mind, the following banner should be used in any source code 
file to indicate the copyright and license terms:
